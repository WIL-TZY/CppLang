In C++, the << character is known as the "left shift" operator. Meanwhile, the >> character is known as the "right shift" operator.

They are used to perform bitwise shift operations on integral data types, such as integers. 

These operators allow you to shift the bits of a binary representation of a number to the left or right.

Left Shift (<<): This operator shifts the bits of a binary number to the left by a specified number of positions. 
Right Shift (>>): This operator shifts the bits of a binary number to the right by a specified number of positions. 

The format is: 
value << n 
Where value is the number you want to shift, and n is the number of positions to shift it to the left.

The << operator is often used for tasks related to manipulating individual bits.
A common task is performing efficient multiplication/division by powers of 2, and various low-level bit manipulation operations. 

In the bitwise_operations.cpp file, there's an example using x = 5 (decimal) or 00000101 (binary).

x is then shifted by the << operator 2 two positions to the left.

This effectively multiplyes x by 2^2, resulting in the value 20 (decimal) or 00010100 (binary).
