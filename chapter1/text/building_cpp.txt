To build a C++ program, you need to first certify that you are in the right directory (the directory of the file you're trying to build).

Once there, you can use this command in the terminal:  
    g++ -o my_program.exe  my_program.cpp

And then, you can run the program by running this other command:
    ./my_program.exe

Alternatively, you can use a one-liner command to do both things by doing like so:
    g++ -o my_program.exe  my_program.cpp && ./my_program.exe

In Vscode's c_cpp_properties.json file, you need to add these:
"compilerPath": "C:\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin\\g++.exe",
"intelliSenseMode": "windows-gcc-x64"
